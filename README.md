## Issue with Predator Sense Detection and Installation

I encountered an issue while trying to download **Predator Sense** for my Acer Predator laptop.

When I entered my **Serial Number / SNID / Model Number** on the official Predator support page  
https://www.acer.com/ae-en/predator/support/drivers-manuals/drivers-and-manuals  
the website failed to detect my device and did not provide any software downloads.

However, when I used the **same Serial Number or SNID** on Acer’s main support website, my laptop was detected correctly. Despite that, **Predator Sense was not listed** among the available software.

To resolve this, I posted the issue on the Acer Community forum:

https://community.acer.com/en/discussion/comment/1372451?tab=all#Comment_1372451

Based on the explanations provided there, a community member shared a **direct download link** for Predator Sense that matches my laptop model.

**Predator Sense download link (provided by the community):**  
https://global-download.acer.com/GDFiles/Application/Predator%20Sense/Predator%20Sense_Acer_3.00.3152_W10x64_A.zip?acerid=637509448561061887&Step1=&Step2=&Step3=PREDATOR%20PH315-53&OS=ALL&LC=en&BC=ACER&SC=PA_6

Using this link, I was able to successfully download and install **Predator Sense** on **Windows 11**, and the software works as expected and in this repo I am storing the software incase I forget how and why I installed the software.
